        Siddha Gufa is considered to be Nepal's largest cave, measuring 437 metres deep and 50 metres high. Its cathedral-like interior is filled with stalactites and stalagmites, as well as hundreds of bats that whistle overhead. Trekking to and from Bandipur is a popular (although muddy) half-day adventure that requires a 1½-hour climb each way. Consider hiring a guide from the Bandipur Tourist Information Centre. Alternatively, you can walk up to the cave from Bimalnagar via the Prithvi Highway, which takes only 45 minutes.
